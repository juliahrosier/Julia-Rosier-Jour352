Part 1:

1. <a href=“https://www.google.com/“>Google is the best search engine in the world.</a>

2. The DIV tag creates another section within an HTML document. The DIV tag is commonly used as a container for HTML elements that can be further designed and managed from the CSS stylesheet.

3.
< ! DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>Title of the Page</title>
</head>
<body>

<h1>Heading 1</h1>
<p>Paragraph</p>

</body>
</html>

4. I would put the link to a stylesheet after the <head> tag and underneath the title. The link to the stylesheet would go before the </head> tag and before the <body> tag. In other words, it would go in the head.

5. I would put text, images, and DIV tags within the body.

6.
<div class=“graphic box”>
</div>

<div id=“name”>Julia Rosier
</div>

7.
<div id=“apples”>
</div>
<div class=“fruit”>
</div>

8.
.fruit {
 font-family: open sans, arial, sans-sans-serif;
 font-size: 1em;
 margin-right: 0;
 margin-left: 0;
 margin-top: 10px;
 margin-bottom: 10px;
 color: #000000;
}

9. <img> and </img>

10. We use media queries because they allow us in CSS to change the content to fit different screen sizes.

11. Serif has a more creative/fancy branch-like design at the end of letters. Sans-serif does not have this so the difference is in the design of the letters.
